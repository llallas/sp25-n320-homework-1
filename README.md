## Assignment 1: Git Readme

### Full-Stack Web Development

Working on web applications' front-end (user interface) and back-end (server-side logic, databases) is known as full stack development. Using front-end tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and back-end languages like Node.js, Python, or Ruby, as well as databases to store data, a full stack developer is proficient in both technologies. They have the ability to create and manage full web applications.

### Node.js Understanding

A JavaScript runtime environment called Node.js enables programmers to execute JavaScript code on the server side. It is effective and lightweight for developing scalable web applications because it employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O approach. Because of its ability to manage high concurrency, Node.js is frequently used for back-end development and is appropriate for real-time applications such as chat systems or APIs. It is frequently used in conjunction with frameworks like as Express.js to streamline server-side routing and logic. Node.js simplifies the development process by enabling developers to utilize JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development.
### Version Control, Git, & GitHub
#### Version Control is a system that tracks changes to files and enables multiple people to collaborate on a project without interfering with each other's work. It helps manage different versions of code, making it easier to review, revert, and merge changes.

#### Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code, create branches for different features or bug fixes, and merge these changes back into the main codebase. Git keeps a complete history of the project and helps coordinate work across multiple developers.

#### GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories. It allows developers to store and share their code, collaborate on projects, and manage version control remotely. GitHub provides additional features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools, making it a popular choice for open-source and team-based development.


### Markdown & Documentation
Markdown is a simple markup language used to format plain text with easy-to-read syntax, commonly for writing documentation and README files. Documentation explains how software works, provides setup instructions, and guides users and developers. Markdown is widely used for creating clear and structured documentation because itâ€™s easy to write, read, and convert into formats like HTML.
